Lab 01: Linux Access Control & Stream Manipulation
Date: 05/01/2026
Status: Completed
Environment: Kali Linux (VirtualBox)
1. Objective
The goal of this session was to master Linux file system permissions, user management, and I/O stream redirection. These concepts are fundamental for understanding privilege escalation vulnerabilities and managing secure systems.
2. Technical Steps
A. User & Group Management
I created two distinct users to simulate a production environment:
dev_user: A privileged user.
test_user: A restricted user.
top_secret: A security group for sensitive access.
Commands executed:
code
Bash
# Creating standard users
sudo adduser dev_user
sudo adduser test_user

# Creating the security group
sudo addgroup top_secret

# Adding dev_user to the group (Corrected syntax)
sudo usermod -a -G top_secret dev_user
Verification:
I verified the group membership using the id command:
code
Text
uid=1001(dev_user) gid=1001(dev_user) groups=1001(dev_user),100(users),1003(top_secret)
B. File Permissions (The Vault)
I created a secured directory (boveda) to practice the Principle of Least Privilege.
Owner (Me): Full Access (rwx).
Group (top_secret): Read & Execute (r-x).
Others: No Access (---).
Configuration:
code
Bash
# Creating directory and file
mkdir ~/boveda
echo "Top Secret Plan" > ~/boveda/plan_maestro.txt

# Changing ownership to the group
sudo chgrp -R top_secret ~/boveda

# Applying Octal Permissions 750
# 7 (Owner) = 4+2+1 (Read+Write+Execute)
# 5 (Group) = 4+0+1 (Read+Execute)
# 0 (Others) = No permissions
chmod 750 ~/boveda
C. I/O Stream Redirection (The Black Hole)
I learned to manipulate Standard Output (stdout, Descriptor 1) and Standard Error (stderr, Descriptor 2). The goal was to hide error messages generated by a command.
Command executed:
code
Bash
# Listing a valid and an invalid directory.
# 2> redirects ONLY errors to the log file.
ls -l /home /root/secreto_falso 2> errores.log
Result (Log Content):
code
Text
ls: cannot access '/root/secreto_falso': Permission denied
3. Security Validation
To confirm the security controls, I attempted to access the vault as test_user (who is NOT in the top_secret group).
code
Bash
sudo -u test_user ls ~/boveda
Output:
ls: cannot access '/home/nightweaver01/boveda': Permission denied
4. Conclusion
I successfully implemented a secure file permission structure using octal codes and managed user groups. I also demonstrated how to separate error logs from standard output, which is crucial for script debugging and stealthy operations.
